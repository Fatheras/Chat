Technologies used:

-Express framework. Used earlier, a simple minimalistic framework
-socket.io. I did not use until this point, it was necessary to create a real-time application. Has caused most difficulties
-ejs. Used earlier, I liked the syntax more than other similar templates
-bootstrap 4.1. Used earlier, in this project was almost not used
-jquery library. Used before, a huge toolkit
