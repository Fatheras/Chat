Technologies used:

-express framework. Used earlier, a simple minimalistic framework

-socket.io. I did not use until this point, it was necessary to create a real-time application. Has caused most difficulties

-ejs. Used earlier, I liked the syntax more than other similar templates

-bootstrap 4.1. Used earlier, in this project was almost not used

-jquery library. Used earlier, a huge toolkit

# How to start
Use git clone to download the application =>
use command npm install to install necessary packages =>
use npm start to start the application.

I spent about 12 hours to create this application.
